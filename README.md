## Repository Structure

### 1. `01-Basics/`
This directory contains foundational knowledge and introductory materials across various topics. It is organized into subdirectories based on subject areas.

- **`programming/`:** Focuses on programming languages and their basic concepts.
  - **`python/`:** Contains Python-related notes, syntax explanations (`syntax.md`), and example codes (`examples/`).
  - **`rust/`:** Documents Rust basics and includes notes and examples.
  - Additional languages can be added as subdirectories.
- **`catalog/`:** Includes notes and exercises on data catalog.
- **`lakehouse/`:** Covers solutions like Iceberg, Paimon, and other technologies.

### 2. `02-Intermediate/`
This directory contains intermediate-level knowledge and deeper explorations into specific domains.

- **`machine-learning/`:** Notes, experiments, and tutorials related to machine learning.
- **`databases/`:** Covers database concepts, queries, and optimizations.
- Add new domains as needed, following the same structure.

### 3. `03-Projects/`
This directory is dedicated to hands-on project work, where practical applications of learned concepts are documented.

- Each project is organized in its own subdirectory (e.g., `project-1/`, `project-2/`).
- Each project folder typically includes:
  - **`README.md`:** Overview of the projectâ€”its purpose, requirements, and key takeaways.
  - Source code, configurations, and other project-specific files.

### 4. `References/`
This directory serves as a collection of external resources and materials used during the learning process.

- **`books.md`:** A list of recommended books, with brief descriptions and key takeaways.
- **`links.md`:** A curated list of useful links to articles, videos, and other resources.
- Additional reference files can be added as needed.
